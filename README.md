Training Transitive and Commutative Multimodal Transformers with LoReTTa (NeurIPS 2023)

## Overview

This is the official repository for the multimodal learning paradigm LoReTTa ($`\textbf{L}`$inking mOdalities with a tRansitive and commutativE pre-Training sTrAtegy). While we regret that we cannot release the full code due to internal policy, we do our best to guide interested researchers in reproducing or implementing our work.
